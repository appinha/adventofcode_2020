## 🗣️ About

This is the **first time** I participate in the event and have greatly enjoyed it! So much fun and learning in the process 😀

I had little Python experience (and no formal education in CS) prior to Advent of Code 2020 and after completing all 25 puzzles in full I feel very confident about my recently acquired skills. It allowed me to deepen my knowledge of Python's data structures, learn to use many handy libraries and tools, and even develop a personal style for coding in Python.

A delightful surprise was to experience in practical terms the concepts of algorithm and data structure analysis (computational complexity). Some puzzles force the writing of efficient and well thought code in order to obtain a result within a reasonable amount of time, thus promoting a valuable opportunity to evidence the importance of such intelligence.

I tried following some **principles** when developing my solutions:

* write well structured, readable and scalable code;
* explore features and tools from the programming language;
* take advantage of standard and widely used libraries.

Finally, I'm ecstatic for **completing** the puzzles within 24 days (I started only on the 6th) and learning this much in such a short amount of time! I have become a fan of the event and will definitely continue to participate and even try to complete the other years' puzzles 😁

## 🌟 What is *Advent of Code*?

	🚀 TLDR: an online event where a two-part programming puzzle is released each day from Dec 1st to 25th.

[Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com) is an online event created by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/). In his words:

> Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

### 🎄 This year story for the puzzles

> After saving Christmas [five years in a row](https://adventofcode.com/events), you've decided to take a vacation at a nice resort on a tropical island. Surely, Christmas will go on without you.
>
> The tropical island has its own currency and is entirely cash-only. The gold coins used there have a little picture of a starfish; the locals just call them **stars**. None of the currency exchanges seem to have heard of them, but somehow, you'll need to find fifty of these coins by the time you arrive so you can pay the deposit on your room.
>
>To save your vacation, you need to get all **fifty stars** by December 25th.
>
>Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants **one star**. Good luck!

## 📑 Contents

My solutions for the puzzles are available in the folder [📁 my_solutions](my_solutions) and are organized into subfolders for each day of the event. There is also a subfolder called [📁 common_core](common_core) containing the main framework developed to streamline coding of puzzle solutions.

Inside each subfolder, the following files can be found:

* `input_test.txt` - text file containing input from tests given in the puzzle.
* `input.txt` - text file containing my personal input for the puzzle.
* `main.py` - Python code for solving the puzzle.
* `Makefile` - script for running the puzzle solving code.

## 🛠️ Usage

Inside each `day_*` folder, run `make` to get the solution for my personal input for the puzzle or `make test` to get solutions for the tests given in the puzzle.

![Screenshot of usage of make and make test](usage1.png)

Some puzzles have different test input for each part; in this case, run `make test1` fort Part One's test and `make test2`for Part Two's test.
