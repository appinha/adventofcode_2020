## What is *Advent of Code*?

> **TLDR:** an online event where a two-part programming puzzle is released each day from Dec 1st to 25th.

[*Advent of Code*](http://adventofcode.com) is an online event created by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/).

It consists of *"an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other."* - source: https://adventofcode.com/about

## Puzzles' Story

> After saving Christmas [five years in a row](https://adventofcode.com/events), you've decided to take a vacation at a nice resort on a tropical island. Surely, Christmas will go on without you.
>
> The tropical island has its own currency and is entirely cash-only. The gold coins used there have a little picture of a starfish; the locals just call them **stars**. None of the currency exchanges seem to have heard of them, but somehow, you'll need to find fifty of these coins by the time you arrive so you can pay the deposit on your room.
>
>To save your vacation, you need to get all **fifty stars** by December 25th.
>
>Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants **one star**. Good luck!
